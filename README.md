## Overview

This project provides a clean and modern interface for managing quick digital sticky notes. Users can easily add new notes with a click, type short messages (under a word limit), drag them anywhere on the screen, and discard them when no longer needed.

Key features include automatic saving of notes to the browser's local storage, ensuring your notes persist between sessions. The application defaults to a sleek dark theme but includes a toggle for switching to a light theme. It's designed to be responsive and functional across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes. New notes cycle through a pleasant palette of pastel colors.

This project was created by Ram Bapat as part of the **#30DaysOfVibeCoding** challenge (April 2025), utilizing AI assistance for rapid development, brainstorming, and code generation/refinement.
